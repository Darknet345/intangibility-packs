# Potion of Intangibility
This datapack adds a "Potion of Intangibility" that allows players to phase through walls while crouching.

To create a potion, start with any Potion of Invisibility, add them to a brewing stand, and throw a chorus fruit on top of the brewing stand.  
The chorus fruit will be added to the ingredient slot automatically (don't know why valid ingredients aren't controlled by a tag).

After having the potion effect applied, the player can crouch to walk through solid objects.  
Currently doesn't work on beds or doors, but otherwise works for blocks regardless of block properties or NBT.
